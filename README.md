# Evaluating-AI-Assisted-Coding-Solutions-for-Developer-Productivity

This project investigates whether AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub Copilot, StarCoder, and ChatGPT meaningfully enhance developer productivity and whether they could potentially replace human software engineers and data scientists. Using 1.36 TiB of GitHub Archive data stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), commit patterns were analyzed to identify trends in commit volume, language shifts, repository growth, and commit uniqueness using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH).

Findings and Conclusion:

Increased Productivity: AI tools accelerate coding tasks by offering suggestions, fixing bugs, and automating repetitive work, allowing developers to focus on creative problem-solving.

Commit Behavior: While AI tools enhance code quality and reduce errors, top contributors continue to make high-volume commits, emphasizing the necessity of human expertise.

Technology Integration: AI reduces development time and costs, but human oversight remains critical for system design, debugging, and maintenance.

Text Similarity Analysis: LSH analysis shows a higher rate of duplicated AI-generated code, indicating the need for human supervision to ensure originality and relevance.

Overall, AI assistants are powerful aids in enhancing productivity but are unlikely to replace human developers, who remain indispensable for innovation and complex problem-solving.
