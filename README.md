# Evaluating-AI-Assisted-Coding-Solutions-for-Developer-Productivity

A number of AI-powered coding assistants have recently been developed to augment human software developers and engineers such as GitHub Copilot, StarCoder, Code Llama, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT. These tools aim to enhance developer productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and provide intelligent code suggestions.

This project explores whether AI-assisted coding solutions provide meaningful improvements in developer productivity and whether they have the potential to eventually replace human software engineers and data scientists. By analyzing commit patterns in publicly available GitHub repositories using GitHub Archive data (1.36 TiB) stored in Google Cloud Storage, we investigate key trends, including commit volume distribution, language popularity shifts, repository growth, and the uniqueness of commit messages.

Through data-driven insights, we assess the impact of AI-generated code on software development workflows, identifying whether AI tools supplement or disrupt traditional programming roles.
